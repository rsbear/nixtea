### 2024-16-12 context
Here's where we stand:

We're working on the `ctx update` command functionality for the nixtea project, which is a CLI tool for managing nix flake outputs as long-running processes/services.

Key accomplishments so far:
1. Cleaned up database code by removing state table and consolidating repos functionality
2. Added basic `ctx update` command structure
3. Started implementing nixapi.UpdateFlake

Current Challenge:
We're working through how to properly update a flake repository (github:rsbear/deployments) to get fresh outputs. We know:
- We need `nix flake update` to update the flake's dependencies
- We're running into issues with lock file writing permissions/access
- We need to figure out the right set of flags and approach for the update process

Next time's Focus:
- Determine correct nix flake update command structure and flags
- Get the flake update working properly
- Then move on to implementing the package building and service installation phases

Key files we're working with:
- cli.go (for the ctx update command)
- nixapi/nixapi.go (for flake operations)
- internal/svc package (for service management via kardianos/service)

Would you like me to keep any other context in mind for Next time's session?
