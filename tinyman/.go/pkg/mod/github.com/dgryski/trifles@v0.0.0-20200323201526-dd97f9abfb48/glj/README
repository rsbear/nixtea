A quick demo for passing data from Go to lua via msgpack.

This prevents having to send each individual array value into lua separately,
which is a massive speedup for large arrays.

Sorry about the hard-coded paths for CGO.

Run ./setup.sh to grab the lua_cmsgpack.c source code from
github.com/antirez/lua-cmsgpack . I didn't want to commit it into my repo.

Demo:

$ ./setup.sh && go build . && ./glj
